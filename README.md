Pedastrian flow analysis

Our pedestrian flow analysis solution leverages Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) technology to accurately count the number of people entering and leaving each store.

This data is collected every hour and is segmented by gender and age, providing valuable insights into customer demographics and behavior.

However, like any program, our solution is susceptible to various incidents that may negatively affect the reliability of the data, including hardware failures, network instability, and software bugs. 

Therefore, it's crucial to implement robust data analysis techniques to identify and mitigate potential anomalies in the data.

Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a Python program capable of visualizing the pedestrian flow data and identifying any data anomalies. Two datasets, namely simple_test_case and real_test_case, are provided. Each dataset contains one or several CSV files, with each file storing the pedestrian flow data for a specific store.
